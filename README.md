## Project - Books Management

### Key points
- Create a group database `groupXDatabase`. You can clean the db you previously used and resue that.
- This time each group should have a *single git branch*. Coordinate amongst yourselves by ensuring every next person pulls the code last pushed by a team mate. You branch will be checked as part of the demo. Branch name should follow the naming convention `project/booksManagementGroupX`
- Follow the naming conventions exactly as instructed.

## Testing 
- To test these apis create a new collection in Postman named Project 4 Books Management

- Each request in the collection should be rightly named. Eg Create user, Create book, Get books etc
- Each member of each team should have their tests in running state

Refer below sample
